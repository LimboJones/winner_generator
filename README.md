A simple script to fairly pick a winner of something (e.g the unfairly sized 25th door of an advent calendar)

- Creates a list of players
- Gives a random player 1 point
- Checks if any players have 100 points
- Loops back around until someone wins

Currently best run in the command line to fully appreciate the 'animation'
